  - Please report any issues with this build step in the project's [issues](https://github.com/StarChart-Labs/eclipse-dynamic-templates/issues)
- Create a branch for your work
- Setup your development environment (see below)
- Make changes
- Run in Eclipse to test your changes locally
- Push your branch to your fork
- Make a Pull Request against the `master` branch

## Development Environment Setup

Currently, Eclipse is the supported IDE for development. It is recommended to create an isolated workspace for StarChart Labs projects. You should also import the standard StarChart Labs formatting and save settings from the [eclipse-configuration repository](https://github.com/StarChart-Labs/eclipse-configuration)

## General Standards

In general, pull requests should:
- Be small and focused on a single improvement/bug
- Include tests for changed behavior/new features
- Match the formatting of the existing code
- Have documentation for added methods/classes and appropriate in-line comments
- Have additions to the CHANGE_LOG.md file recording changed behavior

## Conduct

We expect both outside contributors and StarChart Labs members to treat each with respect and promote constructive discussion on how we can create better tools for developers. Please report any inappropriate interactions (with a link to the offending pull request, etc, if possible) to `contributing@starchartlabs.org`
